## Flying Leaf Animation

### What?
A leaf flies into the right corner of the page and a short text fades into the leaf.

### Why?
A customer requested a simple animation of a flying maple leaf, a beech leaf and an oak leaf. The leaves had to fly onto separate pages of a website that had already been developed. Frameworks or libraries may not be included.

### How?
Since there was no immediate possibility to change directly in HTML or CSS of the existing website, the animation had to unfold by manipulating the DOM. Therefore, the task is solved by using pure Javascript to create elements that are appended to the HTML and styled directly in the script.

> In each of the three main folders there is an index file where a demo of the animation for the individual leaf can be seen.
